`bpython` is a fancy interface to the Python interpreter for Linux, BSD, OS X
and Windows (with some work). `bpython` is released under the MIT License. It has
the following (special) features:

  * In-line syntax highlighting
  * Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type.
  * Expected parameter list for any Python function.
  * "Rewind" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.
  * Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin.
  * Save the code you've entered to a file.
  * Auto-indentation.
  * Python 3 support.

A special thanks to `Hacker School`_ who decided to devote a team of young
developers to work on bpython as part of their training programme. They're based
in New York City and have a great attitude towards the development of both male
and female programmers - take a look.

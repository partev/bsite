    <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at this page.</p>
<p>Historically this page contained a bit of text asking people to send me some
donations to show me how much they appreciate the hard work that has been put
into bpython.</p>
<p>Having discussed with the bpython team, we decided that (for various reasons,
not least of all because I haven't written any bpython code in years ...) it
would make a lot more sense to encourage people to give their hard-earned cash
to a worthwhile cause.</p>
<p>These days I can afford to buy my own coffee so, instead of buying one for me,
please think of somebody who might really need that money and send it their way
instead.</p>
<p>If you can't think of anybody who might benefit from a bit of extra cash, I
would like to recommend the <cite>Perseid School &lt;https://www.perseid.merton.sch.uk/&gt;</cite>
(donation page <cite>here &lt;https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/finalCharityHomepage.action?uniqueVmgCharityUrl=FriendsOfPerseidSchoolMorden&gt;</cite>).</p>
<p>I would also encourage the bpython team to add any other charities that they would like to raise awareness for.</p>
